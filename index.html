        <p>Yes, I believe in hell. This world is the hell itself. Everyday, I am tortured. The world tortures me, the truth tortures me. Although, I still have to fight. I have to live and endure all the pain and sadness that I feel because those will make me stronger to fulfill my purpose and to learn to be better person. I believe that we were born in this world in order to clean our soul. I have to be prepared so that when the time comes that I will have to leave this world, I am ready for the next phase that we are all uncertain what it will be.</p>
